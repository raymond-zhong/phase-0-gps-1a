# Relections

**What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
Git is still relatively foreign to me and while I get the concepts in a high-level sense, the actual implementation of it has been something I have struggled with for the past week.

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
We spent some time discussing the fetch/merge versus pull which helped to clarify the confusion I had around that.

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
We asked a lot of questions about the difference between Git and GitHub. I think we were both having some trouble making the distinction between them.

**What still confuses you about Git?**
I feel like I should spend some time understanding branches further. I am unsure about when/where to create one.

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
It was very helpful having a guide there to ask questions or clarify any confusion we have had about the task or the code.
